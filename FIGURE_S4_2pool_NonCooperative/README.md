### Parameter profiles and capacitance vs. pulse duration plots
#### Two-pool Non-cooperative Exocytosis Model 
Execute script RUN_THIS_FIRST.m, which will produce all figures. <br>
Make sure you download the MATLAB parallel toolbox. <br>
Note: parameter profile code may take 1-3 hours on a 10-core CPU.<br>
Generated figures aren't in the manuscript, except as part of Fig. S4C.
